# Assignment 02
### *Announced*: 
Tuesday, second week of class
### *Due*: 
Items #1-#6 are due by the *beginning* of lab on Friday this week (second week of class)

### *Short description of assignment*:
Create a cookie recipe in a plain text file

### Details:
1. Look up your favorite cookie recipe
2. Write it down in a plain text file.  NOTE about good scholarship: 
**You need to include FULL ATTRIBUTION for the source of the recipe.  If you don't, that's plagiarism!**
3. About plain text:

	3a. MAC USERS: use TextEdit with "Preferences" set to "plain text" (NOT rich text)

	3b. WINDOWS USERS: This should be a plain text file you know how to navigate to in git-bash.  Try Notepad or Notepad++

	3c. LINUX USERS: Try `gedit`.
 
4. Still not sure about "plain text" or how to create it?  See the [software guide](https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git/blob/master/CourseDocuments/SoftwareRequirements.md)
5. Save your recipe in a subdirectory for this class such as `..../EBIO_4420/CompBioLabsAndHomework/`
6. You do NOT have to send this file to Sam, but you must have this file available for use in lab on Friday.

### Completion:
All of the above should be done prior to lab (as noted above).  However, the assignment will be considered to be complete when you have successfully completed **ALL steps of Lab 02**, because I will be grading it based upon what appears on your GitHub account.  Don't worry, we'll do all the setup for that in lab on Friday.
