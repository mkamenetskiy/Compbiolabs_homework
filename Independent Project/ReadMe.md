Your Title
Biological question
This question should be stated as a question that can be understood independently of knowing about the specific dataset that is being used to address it.

Context (introduction)
This should help a naive reader make sense of what to expect and why it is interesting. It should make sense even before the reader reads the Methods.

Methods
The source of the data:
Describe the data you used to study your question and its origins. (Give FULL citations with working hyperlinks for the original publication AND the data package, if applicable).

Give a description (one or two paragraphs) of how the data were produced.

Give a description of the size and nature of the data. Feel free to comment on any special challenges presented by any aspect of the data.

What the original authors did with the data:
Give about 1 - 2 paragraphs of explanation.

What YOU did with the data and how you did it:
Verbally describe what your approach was and how you achieved it. You don't need to include code here; rather, the goal is to give the reader an idea of what your code does and why and how it does it. Don't give the results here, though. Throughout this section, strive to be crystal clear about which things the original authors did and which things you did. Saying "this study" is ambiguous in that regard, so make it clear.

Results and conclusions
What did you find? How does this relate to your question? Include at least one visualization.

References Cited
Give full bibliographic information for all cited references. There should be a one-to-one correspondence: each reference listed here should be cited at least once in the main text, and each reference cited above should be listed here. Please follow standard practices of citation and bibliography.
