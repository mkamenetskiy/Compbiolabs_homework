#Parts 1 and 3 of final exam, Kamenetskiy
#Question 1
nano stuff.txt
#or 
view stuff.txt
#or 
less stuff.txt #This one if for purely view options, the others you can edit from

#Question 2
wc -l foo.txt

#Question 3
grep "Hirundo" Birds.txt > Hirundo.txt
grep -i "Hirundo" Birds.txt > Hirundo.txt #This is for case insenitive finds! 

#Question 4
grep "Hirundo" Birds.txt | wc -l #This is using a pipe

#Part 2!!

#Question 5
#Version control is a system that essentially keeps track of the history of the versions of a file. It allows for your working directory and what you "see" in your directories to be much cleaner since you do not have to have every revised version of your documents in your directory. It acts a lot like google docs in my mind. You continuously make edits to a document, but you only work with the most revised version when you open it up again. However, google docs saves the documents and all revisions done to it. 

#Question 6
#Git is a software that can act as a command line tool! When initialized, git creates a "repository" in which it creates a directory with the name .git that is usually hidden from the user's view. The repository stores your revisions once you add, commit and push to it! 

#Question 7
#

#Question 8
#The series of commands for those with git and github will use the following lines in order to add a version of a file to github. 
#git add Something.txt
#git commit -m "Message Here"
#git push 

#Question 9
#Well, if you have not pushed the file to git hub yet, you can do git status and it would tell you the difference between the two files. I have now changed it.
